# Competition Code Grabber

Little utility to grab daily competition codes from TV streaming websites. 

Currently only doing channel 7, but not actually functional yet. 

Available functionality:
* Filter the collected images to only keep valid images (otherwise there'll be thousands a day

Future functionality
* Identify the actual text in the relevant images
* Email the codeword for each day
* Automatically text the codeword each day (not sure if able to programatically text to 1800 numbers)
